# TAT FOLIO

The tattoo industry, like many artistic fields, uses Instagram as it's primary avenue of business and marketing. This makes no sense. Instagram is not built for tattoo artists. TAT FOLIO is not social media. It is not here to create egos, but rather to connect artists with clients and clients with artists. This app is client centric, but made with the artist in mind. The benefits to Instagram include but are certainly not limited to:

 * Users can easily search posts and artist by various types of keywords
 * Users can explore pages catered to their unique tastes
 * Users can click on tags or styles to view related posts
 * Artists can rearange and organize portfolio however they want
 * Artists can edit their posts

Home feed, essentially the same view as liked/discover/search results

Edit and delete buttons become visible on the post cards when the artist views his/her posts
